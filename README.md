# RaspberryPiDotNet

To install dotnet on your Raspberry Pi take a look at https://www.petecodes.co.uk/install-and-use-microsoft-dot-net-5-with-the-raspberry-pi/

My code has an appsetting.json file which has a couple of settings that need completing for this code to work.

Storage: This is the connection string for Azure Blob Storage
LocalPath: This is the path to where the camera will save its photos to, something like /home/pi/ is all you need but feel free to specify what you need.
